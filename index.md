Hi!! I am a PhD student at UC San Diego, advised by Julian McAuley the Great. I'm currently working on generative retrieval and recommendation, eg transformer-based models for sequential recommendation. I'm interested in semantic IDs, tokenizers, and quantization in generative recommendation systems. In  In the past, I've worked on biomedical document retrieval, primarily using dense retrievers and text embedding models, in addition to reranking and document similarity. My interests include information retrieval, recommender systems, embedding models, representation learning, scholarly document processing, biomedical NLP, AI for healthcare, machine learning, ethics, HCI. I'm funded by a NSF CS graduate research fellowship.
